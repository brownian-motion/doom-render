# Doom-Style Renderer

This is my custom implementation of a simple 3-D renderer, designed similarly to the classic engines in *Doom* and *Duke Nukem*.

It is heavily inspired by (and loosely follows) **Bisqwit**'s Youtube Video [*Creating a Doom-style 3d engine in C*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQYsFshbkYw).
